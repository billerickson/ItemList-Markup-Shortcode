# ItemList Markup Shortcode

If you're writing a "round-up" article, or summarizing multiple posts, you can use structured data to make your Google search results eligible for a list-like carousel display. See [this Google guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/mark-up-listings) for more information.

This plugin allows you to generate the necessary markup using a simple shortcode and including a list of post IDs. Example: `[itemlist_markup ids="123,456"]`

If you have [Shortcode UI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/) installed and are using the Classic editor, you'll get a full user interface for inserting the shortcode.
